    # üè´Bachelor's degree in computer science.
    
    I completed my studies with an average score of **8.81**. 
    I'm currently in the process of completing the necessary 
    steps for my graduation. During my studies, my main focus 
    was on the field of artificial intelligence, which greatly 
    intrigued me.

    Mathematics has always been a subject I enjoyed, and I delved 
    into topics such as linear algebra, probability, and calculus. 
    I also gained knowledge in **heuristic algorithms, including
    simulated annealing, the bee algorithm, and genetic algorithms**.

    My educational path also involved learning about simulation 
    techniques like the **Monte Carlo method**. I explored project 
    management for software development and became familiar with 
    agile methodologies like **SCRUM**.

    I developed a solid understanding of computer architecture and 
    engaged in low-level programming. On the practical side, I 
    worked on various projects using technologies such as **JavaScript, 
    CSS, HTML, JAVA, and Spring Boot**.

    In summary, my university experience was characterized by a 
    strong interest in artificial intelligence, a passion for
    mathematics, and hands-on experience in various technical 
    domains. As I work towards obtaining my degree, I'm excited 
    to continue advancing my career in the technology field.

    # ü´ÇVolunteer experience and extracurricular activities
    
    In 2022, I was the president of the Computer Society student 
    chapter, where I organized and led various activities throughout 
    the year. It was a fantastic experience because I learned how to 
    guide a team and coordinate different tasks with professors and
    academic staff from other universities.

    The primary goal of the team was to arrange events to spread 
    technological knowledge across various areas, and also provide 
    workshops and courses for incoming students or individuals keen
    on technology beyond the university.

    Despite the challenges of being a small project, the experience 
    was enjoyable, and it provided me with the chance to engage in 
    other volunteer activities within the university, such as 
    assisting at the Carlos Graef Institute, participating in the 
    science fair, and guiding new students.
